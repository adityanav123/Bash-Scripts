# vim
vim configuration file I wrote for compiling and executing C/C++ codes along with some visual customisations.

F5 to compile and execute C/C++ files directly from vim.

1. create a new vimrc file
  MacOS - (from VIM) :e $HOME/.vimrc
  Linux - sudo vim /etc/vim/vimrc.local

2. copy content
3. :source % --> from vim.
